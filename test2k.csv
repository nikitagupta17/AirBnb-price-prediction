Near bars, restaurants, subway. Very clean and perfect for NYC vaca! I love hosting, happy to help with travel, food, entertainment arrangements. Includes wi-fi and stocked fridge. The space is amazing, and mine! :) It's warm and cozy, relaxing and quiet, safe, and my bed is very comfy. Gramercy is one of the most sought after locations in the city! I promise you'll enjoy. I live very close to 2 Citibike locations as well which make getting around the city very easy! 2 people can comfortably sleep here in the bedroom, but if you have 2 extra people, there's a couch that turns into a full size bed. I will leave extra sheets for the couch. You will have access to my full apartment, aside from closets.  I don't have much interaction with guests. I'll meet you to give you the keys! I'll help make suggestions with where to go, things to do, where to eat, play, run, and anything else I can do to make your stay more enjoyable.
